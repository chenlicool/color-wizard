# Systematic Color Palette Generator

Welcome to my Palette Generator. I have built this tool as I was struggling to find a palette generator that was easy to use and customize. I hope you find it useful.
          
Systematic palette generator uses a parabolic formula to autofill color saturation for various intervals, given color hue and luminance. The tools gives you a wide range of control over palette parameters and allows you to bulk edit HSL levels, as well as define the number of shades and hues in your palette. It also makes it easier to work color contrast and accessibility.

Each color swatch also shows you the color contrast against black/white text. WCAG 2.0 specification requires color contrast of at least 4.5:1 for texts under 18pt (24px) for a contrast to be considered accessible for people with vision impairments.
